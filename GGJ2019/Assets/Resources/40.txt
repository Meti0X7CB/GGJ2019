Rick:
Hey there!
What are you doing out so late?

Rect:
I�m just looking around;
I have to get used to this city.

Rick:
Are you new around here?


Rect:
Yeah, just moved in down the street the other day.


Rick:
Well, I�m sure you have time to find your way around tomorrow.


Rect:
Nah, I should do it as soon as I can.
I live here now, so I have to adjust as soon as I can.

Rick:
Where are you from?


Rect:
That�s not important.
I�m here now, so that�s the only thing that matters.

Rick:
...I see...
