Triangle:
Hoi mister, did that key I give you help?


Rick:
Yeah, it helped.
Thanks.

Triangle:
Sugoi!
Glad to help you, mister!

Rick:
So, what are you doing out so late?


Triangle:
Helping people!


Rick:
Helping people?


Triangle:
Yeah, it’s what I do at night.
I go around for odd jobs and things that I can do to help.

Rick:
Why?


Triangle:
...why?
...I suppose I never really gave it much thought…
I guess because helping people makes us all better off!
Triangle:
We’re all together in life; part of one big community!


Rick:
So you help because you consider these people
part of your community?

Triangle:
Yeah!


Rick:
...I see...
