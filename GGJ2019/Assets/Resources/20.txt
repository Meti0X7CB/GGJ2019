Saitama:
Yo, what�s up?


Rick:
Not much.
What are you up to so late?

Saitama:
Nothing really; just bored actually.


Rick:
Bored?
You have nothing to do?

Saitama:
What�s the point of it?
You can get better at something, but in the end,
perfection never ends.
Rick:
Isn�t there some point you want to reach?
Some pinicle you can stop at?

Saitama:
...perhaps, but I wouldn�t know where it is;
easier to just try.

Rick:
But where does that leave you?


Saitama:
Nowhere really; but nowhere isn�t exactly the worst place to be.
Not after you get used to it.

Rick:
...I see...
