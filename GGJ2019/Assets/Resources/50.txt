Rick:
Hey there, little buddy.
What are you doing out so late?

Little Circle:
I was walking out with my mommy earlier,
but we got seperated.
*sniff* I can’t find her now.
Rick:
Well, I can try to help you find her.


Little Circle:
No, I can’t go with you; just my mommy!


Rick:
Why is that?


Little Circle:
Because I need her.
She makes me feel safe.
I’m scared without her here!
Rick:
Well, why don’t you join me for a bit,
and we can try to find her?

Little Circle:
NO!
I’m going to wait here for her to come for me!

Rick:
...I see...
