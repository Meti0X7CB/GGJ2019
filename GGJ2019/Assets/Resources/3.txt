How you like me now? Bitch
This is for that time in high school when you stole my lunch.

“Forgiveness is hard work. It’s instinctual to feel anger toward and maybe even
want and seek revenge against those who hurt us. Forgiveness can help us maintain
relationships, keeping us focused on the present relationship and not what happened
in the past. When we forgive, we move away from the damage that insults, betrayals,
and slights did to our relationship, and move into the present, to what’s happening now,
continuing to stay in connection with people who matter to us. Forgiving acknowledges
that the transgression happened and that it was hurtful. And it allows us to move away from it,
to focus on the present.“
