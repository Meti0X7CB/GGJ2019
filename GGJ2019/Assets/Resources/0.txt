Hi, I think I’m lost…


Cigarette Guy:
Oh, Hi ...
This is Flatland.
So you don't remember anything?
X:
No …
I don't even remember my name.

Cigarette Guy:
Your name is Rick.


X:
Rick!?


Cigarette Guy:
Yeah, we used to be best friends! You don't remember?


Rick:
No...  I’m sorry...


Cigarette Guy:
Sometimes you find yourself at the bottom of this world with no one to help you like the rest of us. You’ll be fine.


Rick:
But I don't remember anything! I just wanna go back home.


Cigarette Guy:
Whispers: “Now you know how it feels like”


Rick:
What?


Cigarette Guy:
I can help you get to your home!


Rick:
Really?


Cigarette Guy:
Yeah, but you need to help me with a few things first.


Rick:
I would do anything to get my memory back.


Cigarette Guy:
Okay, so I forgot something from my store.
If you could ask the triangle down the street for my spare key to the store.
Tell him I sent you.
